# Load Flow Analyzer

# Programming Platform 
C++14

# Description:

In this project, Object-oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as class, object, abstraction, function overloading, and operator overloading is applied in {\bf C++} to build a power flow analyzer using Gauss-Siedel algorithm for any number of buses.

The analyzer takes system's known information such as bus/line data, and generator/load data and provides output such as voltage magnitude and angle, real and reactive power, and power losses for each node.
